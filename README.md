# WinchRescueMod - DayZ
This winch mod for DayZ will give players a fun, realistic tool for rescuing their stranded vehicles, providing a much-needed solution for pulling vehicles out of deep water or off objects. The mechanics—placement, interaction, cranking, and pulling—should give players a sense of accomplishment when they successfully retrieve their stranded vehicle. This mod is also intended to take a load off server admins who are required to rescue vehicles stranded in deep water or stuck on objects.

Mod is in very early stages.
3d/2d models/icons need some reworking at later stages.
